# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
Syntax! Still getting used the correct way to structure things.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? Good. Writing down funtions with basic uses has been helpful. I tend to take the best notes when I'm reading the material by myself.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
Depends, if I feel its a problem that would be within my ability I'll try to figure it out first, if its just way over my head I'll go to google first before I start coding to get an idea atleast.
